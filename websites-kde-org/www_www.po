"The new Breeze theme, which is still in its infancy, welcomes the user with "
"a <strong>cleaner, modernized user interface</strong>, which improves "
"contrast and reduces visual clutter throughout the workspace. Stronger "
"reliance on typography eases the recognition of UI elements. These changes "
"go together with flatter default theming and improved contrast to improve "
"visual clarity further. Breeze being a new artwork concept, is only starting "
"to show its face. A theme for the workspace components is already available, "
"theming of traditional widgets is under way, and the work on a new icon "
"theme has commenced. The migration to a fully Breeze-themed workspace will "
"be a gradual one, with its first signs showing up in Plasma 5.0.<br /> "
"Plasma 5 brings a <strong>greater level of flexibility and consistency</"
"strong> to core components of the desktop. The widget explorer, window and "
"activity switcher now share a common interaction scheme. More reliance on "
"vertical instead of horizontal lists provides better usability. Moving the "
"window switcher to the side of the screen shifts the user&#x27;s focus "
"towards the applications and documents, clearing the stage for the task at "
"hand."

"Folder View is now the default desktop layout. After some years of shunning "

"View as the default desktop. This brings some icons to the desktop by "
"default, and allows you to put whatever files or folders you want on it for "
"easy access. To make this work, many improvements have been made to Folder "
"View. Spring Loading makes drag-and- dropping files powerful and quick, and "

"Dolphin is KDE's file explorer that helps you search, copy, and open files "

"In this new version, Dolphin adds thumbnails for 3D Manufacturing Format "

"on encrypted file systems such as Plasma Vaults. This is done securely by "
"storing the cached thumbnails on the file system itself, or falling back to "
"generating them but not storing cached versions anywhere if necessary. "

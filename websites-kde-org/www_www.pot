"October 15, 2014. Today, KDE releases Plasma 5.1.0, the first release "
"containing new features since the release of Plasma 5.0 this summer. Plasma "
"5.1 sports a wide variety of improvements, leading to greater stability, "
"better performance and new and improved features. Thanks to the feedback of "
"the community, KDE developers were able to package a large number of fixes "
"and enhancements into this release, among which more complete and higher "
"quality artwork following the new-in-5.0 Breeze style, re-addition of "
"popular features such as the Icon Tasks taskswitcher and improved stability "
"and performance."

"greater consistency across applications. The work to support Wayland as "
"display server for Plasma is still ongoing, with improved, but not complete "
"support in 5.1. <a "

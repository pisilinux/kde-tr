msgid "The main part of the docker is a list of all saved snapshots. At the bottom of the docker, there are three buttons: from left to right, they are :guilabel:`Create snapshot`, :guilabel:`Switch to selected snapshot`, and :guilabel:`Remove selected snapshot`. You can create a snapshot from the current state of the document by clicking :guilabel:`Create snapshot`. Click :guilabel:`Switch to selected snapshot` to switch to the selected snapshot. The undo stack will be discarded after switching. If you would like to save the current state, make another snapshot before switching. Click :guilabel:`Remove selected snapshot` to delete the selected snapshot. You can edit the names of snapshots by double-clicking them."

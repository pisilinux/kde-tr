msgid "The information on this page applies only to the Windows release of Krita. Usually, the %LOCALAPPDATA%\\kritacrash.log log file will contain enough information for the developers to get an idea of why Krita crashed. Using the debug package is only needed when more precise information is needed."

msgid "If you have your Krita version installed and you want to get a backtrace, it's best to download a portable version (either the latest release, or the one that someone told you to try, for example Krita Next or Krita Plus package). Alongside downloading the portable version, download the debug symbols package, too. It should be located in the same place you download Krita. You can see which is which by checking the end of the name of the ZIP file - debug symbols package always ends with *-dbg.zip*."

msgid "Links to the debug packages should be available on the release announcement news item on https://krita.org/, along with the release packages. You can find debug packages for any release either in https://download.kde.org/stable/krita for stable releases or in https://download.kde.org/unstable/krita for unstable releases (for example beta versions). Portable ZIP and debug ZIP are found next to each other."

msgid "SeExpr is an embeddable expression language, designed by Disney Animation, that allows host applications to render dynamically generated content.

msgstr ""

msgid "Raster graphics have two drawbacks. First, once you create them, their resolution is **fixed**. You cannot zoom in and magically get any more detail. And if you need to change them, either you go back to the source and sample it again (which is sometimes impossible), or edit it with a raster graphics program, like Krita."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/seexpr.rst:55
msgid "One of the biggest problems, however, is that we are always limited by the **space** our programs can use; either secondary storage, like SD cards, or RAM. Unless compressed, image memory needs are `quadratic in the size of the image <https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/112505/why-is-my-half-resolution-render-taking-a-quarter-of-the-time-of-the-full-one>`_. For a quick example, the :ref:`create_new_document` dialog of Krita tells you three bits of information: its size in pixels, the size of the pixel itself, and *the total memory needed*."

msgid "SeExpr belongs to a different class, *procedural graphics*. Similar to vector graphics, procedural graphics only need a few KBs of secondary storage for their definition. But they are not defined by mathematical formulae; you actually *code* how the color is calculated at each point of the texture. And, because it is not limited in its precision, you can render complex patterns in your layers at completely arbitrary resolution."

msgid ""
"Plasma Mobile is a software platform for mobile devices. It is not an "
"operating system in itself, it consists of Qt5, the KDE Frameworks, Plasma "
"and various software that's part of the application set. Plasma Mobile can "
"work on top of the Mer distribution, but due to a lack of time and "
"resources, we're currently focusing on KDE Neon on PinePhone as a base for "
"testing and development."

#: content/faq.md:19
msgid ""
"There are projects like [Anbox](https://anbox.io/) which is Android running "
"inside Linux container, and use Linux kernel to execute applications to "
"achieve near-native performance. This could be leveraged in the future to "
"have Android apps running on top of a GNU/Linux system with the Plasma "
"Mobile platform, but it's a complicated task, and as of *today*(September "
"6th, 2020) some distributions already support Anbox and you can run Plasma "
"Mobile on top of those distributions."

"Unknown error.  If you have a cd in the drive try running cdparanoia -vsQ as "
"yourself (not root). Do you see a track list? If not, make sure you have "

"(possible if you have an IDE CD writer) then make sure you check that you "
"have read and write permissions on the generic SCSI device, which is "
"probably /dev/sg0, /dev/sg1, etc.. If it still does not work, try typing "
"audiocd:/?device=/dev/sg0 (or similar) to tell kio_audiocd which device your "
"CD-ROM is."
